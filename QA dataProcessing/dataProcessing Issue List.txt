Refactor Code
Perform a code review and list issues in the program.
1. Rename class to DataProcessing, standard class naming convention
2. Array size needs to be variable since the file size is unknown. Import java.util.ArrayList;
And use an arraylist instead.
3. Should have closed the console Scanner object after its use.
4. Double total is never used and can be deleted
5. It is better to first collect data from files as a string using hasNext(). This will throw less errors while reading from a file. We can further collect the doubles after.
6. Need to check if the data arrayList is empty or not before operating on it.
7. Sorting the data is fine: though better done as a separate function or importing a sorting class such as java.util.Collections
8. When calculating stats. Need to use data.size() for ArrayList
9. med   = data [ length / 2 ] this operation must change when using an ArrayList
10. Do not need to cast length to a Double for mean calculation
11. Do not need import java.io.PrintWriter;
12. Int i = 0 should be local. Global i opens up problems, and should be avoided.
13. Finally, must use try and catch to check for exceptions!
